    "Q1.What is exception in python ? Write the difference between Exception and syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS-- In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, it can be \"caught\" and handled by the program to prevent it from crashing. Exceptions are used to handle various types of errors or exceptional situations that might occur during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the key difference between exceptions and syntax errors in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception occurs during the *runtime* of a program.\n",
    " It is typically caused by factors such as invalid user input, file not found, division by zero, or other unexpected conditions.\n",
    "   Exceptions can be caught and handled using \"try\" and \"except\" blocks to prevent the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Syntax Error:\n",
    "  A syntax error is a type of error that occurs during the *parsing* of the program before it is executed.\n",
    "Syntax errors are caused by violations of the language's grammar rules, such as missing colons, parentheses, or incorrect variable names.\n",
    "    These errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program begins to run, so they must be fixed before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are runtime errors that can be handled to prevent program crashes, while syntax errors are detected during the parsing phase and need to be fixed before running the program."
